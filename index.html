              identify trends in their target consumers’ behaviour and adapt
              accordingly. Marketing continues to be one of the fastest-growing
              industries, and attracts workers from all kinds of academic and
              vocational backgrounds. Read on to find out more about popular

              <p>
                A Social Media Manager coordinates a company’s activities ocross
                all the socials where they are present. Working closely with
                designers, product managers and other marketing specialists,
                it’s their job to ensure that social media is used to create a
                strong feeling of community and positivity around the brand and
                its products and services. As well as the day-to-day tasks of

                trends, Social Media Managers also have to have one eye on the

                and other important aspects of effective social media marketing
                strategies.

              <h3>Brand Manager</h3>
              <p>
                Brand Managers work at a strategic level to ensure that the
                brands they are responsible for continue to grow healthily in
                the mid-to- long term. Among other tasks, Brand Managers need to
                be able to interpret, analyze and act on data collected on their
                target audiences and market segments. Most Brand Managers will
                have an academic background in marketing, and a deep
                understanding of consumer behaviour, business strategies,
                budgeting and other specialist subjects. Given the dynamic
                nature of the role, some of the key skills needed for a
                successful brand manager are project management, market analysis
                and multitasking.

              <h3>Marketing Executive</h3>
              <p>
                The core of a Marketing Executive’s daily work is the
                development of marketing campaigns to drive sales and profits
                for their company. As part of this process, Marketing Execs are
                expected to be able to devise strategies that are tailored to
                specific audiences and that encompass a wide range of marketing
                strategies including social media campaigns, promotional events,
                website optimisation and finding brand ambassadors. Marketing
                Executives can be found in companies of all sizes and, depending
                on their specific responsibilities, may be expected to
                specialize in a given area such as website SEO or online content
                coordination. The best Marketing Executives will be able to
                adapt quickly to changing market conditions and unforeseen
                events.

              <h3>Marketing Manager</h3>
              <p>
                The Marketing Manager oversees all aspects of marketing within a
                company or institution. They are tasked with coordinating the
                efforts of creative staff, social media teams, marketing
                executives and sales employees to ensure the company’s overall
                marketing efforts are successful. Marketing Managers are also
                responsible for working closely with finance and product teams
                to develop budgets and targeted campaigns throughout the year.
                Although they do often participate in brainstorming sessions,
                the bulk of creative marketing tasks are left to more
                specialized workers. Good Marketing Managers will always be
                fully up-to-date on the deadlines, data, research efforts and
                upcoming product launches at their company.
